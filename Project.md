My first project in Java  
This is a project for my vocational training

## The concept of the application

I enjoyed the license **Ratchet & Clank** from <ins>Playstation Sony &copy;</ins> and I wanted to have a knowledge base like a wikipedia focus on the series.

### The application's goals

This project was made because for me video games is a sort of art and <ins>Sony</ins> threaten to remove the <ins>Playstation Store</ins> and still not allow these games to be freely emulated, I don't want all this art to go without at least conserve the lore, environment and any information about these games.

I want to make an encyclopedia about this saga of video games

#### Hope's and dreams 

In the meantime I just wanted to make an app on all the game in the franchise **Ratchet & Clank** but if I can make it possible I will surely increase the scope of the application to get in my knowledge base.
